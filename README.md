pls don't take this seriously

you'll want to install a few things, python, pygames, random, etc. You should receive errors if you don't have the correct modules and be prompted to install them. 


once python is updated simply navigate to where the file is downloaded in your terminal and type:

```
Python3 [gamefile]
```

then hit enter. For example:

```
Python3 minisnek.py
```
