# Seedphrase Encryptor 

Use the `encrypt.py` function to turn your seedphrase into a random string of 2-3 digit numbers, and decrypt them with the `decrypt.py` function.

This is useful for handling private keys between multiple devices, or engraving the encryption on metal without comprimising your security. Not 100% secure, not bomb proof, but still useful.

## Encrypt

Enter text only with spaces, no commas or punctuation:
```
Enter text to encrypt: this takes your seed phrase from words from string and encrypts them
```

Copy response.

## Decrypt 

Paste response:
```
Enter encrypted text to decrypt: 116 104 105 115 32 116 97 107 101 115 32 121 111 117 114 32 115 101 101 100 32 112 104 114 97 115 101 32 102 114 111 109 32 119 111 114 100 115 32 102 114 111 109 32 115 116 114 105 110 103 32 97 110 100 32 101 110 99 114 121 112 116 115 32 116 104 101 109
